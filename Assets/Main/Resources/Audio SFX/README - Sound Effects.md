# Audio SFX — Lakbay Salita sound effects

**Purpose of this folder:** holds the 25 short sound effects for button presses, typing and game events. They live in a
`Resources` folder so code can load them by name without wiring each clip in every scene, for example
`Resources.Load<AudioClip>("Audio SFX/ui_click")`. That's the same way the background music in `Resources/Audio Soundtrack` loads.

**Status:** the sounds are imported but **not connected to the game yet**. Nothing plays them so far. This file
describes where each sound is meant to go and how it is planned to be connected.

**Where they came from:** synthesized in code by `SFX Ideas/make_sfx.py` at the project root, using the same bamboo
marimba, kulintang gong, bandurria pluck and bell tones as the background music, so music and effects sound like one
game. To change a sound, edit that script, run it, and copy the new `.wav` over the one here (keep the file name).
`SFX Ideas/index.html` is a listening page with a typing demo, a Word Search drag demo and the pause-window switches.

## What each sound is for

### Buttons and menus (every screen)
| File | Use |
|---|---|
| `ui_click` | Any button tap: menu cards, Play, Library, category and level cards, Profile |
| `ui_back` | Back arrows and leaving a screen |
| `ui_open` | Opening a panel: pause window, dialogs, word definition popup |
| `ui_close` | Closing a panel or resuming from pause |
| `toggle_on` | A Music or Sound effects switch turned **on** (also the main-menu music chip) |
| `toggle_off` | A Music or Sound effects switch turned **off** |

### Keyboard and keypad (Wordle, Crossword, Word Search)
| File | Use |
|---|---|
| `key_tap_1`, `key_tap_2`, `key_tap_3` | A letter typed, from the on-screen keypad **or** a physical keyboard. Pick one of the three at random each time so fast typing doesn't sound robotic. |
| `key_delete` | Backspace or erasing a letter |
| `key_enter` | Submitting a guess or answer |
| `word_invalid` | Guess is too short or not in the dictionary (plays with the row shake) |

### Wordle
| File | Use |
|---|---|
| `tile_flip` | Each tile turning over during the reveal (follow the reveal stagger in `WordleWordVerifier`) |
| `tile_correct` | Tile turns green: right letter, right place |
| `tile_present` | Tile turns yellow: letter is in the word, wrong place |
| `tile_absent` | Tile turns gray: letter is not in the word |

### Crossword
| File | Use |
|---|---|
| `cw_cell_select` | Tapping or selecting a crossword square |
| `cw_word_complete` | A whole across/down word filled in correctly |

### Word Search
| File | Use |
|---|---|
| `ws_select` | Each new letter while dragging. Raise `AudioSource.pitch` by about 2 semitones per letter (`Mathf.Pow(2, n * 2 / 12f)`) so the selection "climbs". |
| `ws_found` | Selection matches a hidden word |
| `ws_wrong` | Selection released on something that isn't a word |

### All games
| File | Use |
|---|---|
| `hint` | Using a hint |
| `timer_tick` | Once per second during the last 10 seconds of the timer |
| `win_jingle` | Puzzle solved / level complete |
| `time_up` | Timer ran out or no guesses left |

## Plan for connecting them (summary)

1. **One sound player for the whole game:** a `SoundEffects` script that creates itself at startup and lives across scenes,
   like `Scripts/Audio/BackgroundMusic.cs`. It loads clips from this folder by name and plays them with
   `AudioSource.PlayOneShot`, so overlapping sounds don't cut each other off. It gets a saved **Sound effects on/off**
   setting (PlayerPrefs `SfxMuted`), separate from the music setting.
2. **Button clicks everywhere:** play `ui_click` for every UI `Button` without editing each scene, by adding a small click hook
   to buttons when a scene loads. Back buttons use `ui_back` instead.
3. **Keyboard and keypad:** call the key sounds from the games' existing input code (for example
   `WordleKeyButton` / `WordleKeyboardTyper` for Wordle, and the matching input scripts in Crossword and Word Search),
   so the on-screen keypad and the physical keyboard make the same sounds.
4. **Game events:** call the game sounds where each event already happens in the game controllers (tile reveal results,
   word found, word complete, hint, last-10-seconds timer, win, time up).
5. **Pause window in every game:** add two switches, **Music** (uses `BackgroundMusic.SetMuted`) and **Sound effects** (uses the
   new `SoundEffects` on/off setting). Each switch plays `toggle_on` / `toggle_off`. Opening and closing the pause window
   plays `ui_open` / `ui_close`.
6. **Import settings** (already applied to the clips here): mono, ADPCM compression, *Decompress On Load*. These are short sounds that need to
   start instantly with no delay, which suits that setting better than streaming.
